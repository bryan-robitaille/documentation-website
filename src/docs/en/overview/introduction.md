<title> Introduction - Open Accessible Digital Workspace </title>
</helmet>

## Introduction

A key principle of the Open, Accessible Digital Workspace is to use existing Open Source applications. This can be best achieved by creating an inter-operable mesh between applications, that would provide value by enabling a large-scale open collaboration ecosystem at very little cost.

### What is a Micro-service Architecture

Micro-services, also known as the micro-service architecture, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

* Highly maintainable and testable
* Loosely coupled
* Independently deployable
* Organized around business capabilities
* Owned by a small team

The micro-service architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large and complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

### Who can use the Open, Accessbile Digital Workspace

The Open Accessible Digital Workspace is open for anyone to use! It was originally created to help develop digital collaboration tools used within the Government of Canada, but the system can be adapted to create citizen-focused services or external digital products.
