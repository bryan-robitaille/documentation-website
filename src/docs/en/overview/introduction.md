# Introduction

The Open and Accessible Digital Workspace was borne of the idea of being able to utilize existing Open Source applications, and by creating an inter-operable mesh between them, that would provide value by enabling a large scale open collaboration ecosystem at very little cost.

## What is a Microservice Architecture

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

* Highly maintainable and testable
* Loosely coupled
* Independently deployable
* Organized around business capabilities
* Owned by a small team

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
